Core softwares to process STAP-seq raw sequence reads.

This repository contains the typical software that I wrote for analyses for the paper Arnold et al., Nature Biotechnology 2017.
This repository is in no way comprehensive set of the necessary software for STAP-seq analyses.

The STAP-seq experimental procedure can be further optimize its performance since the first version (first come into working late 2014) I was involved in.

The STAP-seq experimental and computational procedures definitely have improved since the first version. Please verify for the latest setup.
